# odin-SDR-console
ODIN console files, for remote control of PowerSDR
This is the repository for the ODIN SDR console. It provides a "knobs and switches" interface to the PC based SDR.
Created by Laurence Barker G8NJJ and Kjell Karlsen LA2NI
The code runs on an Arduino Due and uses a 3.2" touch screen Nextion display

This has been integrated to PowerSDR mrx ps version 3.4.9 and THETIS version 2.6.7
Currently the code is believed fully working, and provides a wide range of controls. The console encoders and buttons can be configured from a menu. There is documentation available within the repository.
